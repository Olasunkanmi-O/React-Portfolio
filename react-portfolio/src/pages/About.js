        <h1>About  Me</h1>
        <img src={picture} alt="" />
        <p>After 7 years in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods as a logistics personnel, I realized I wanted more and as such,
        I decided to branch into tech. I got into the front End development of web and web applications and I have never
        been happier. I have worked with some other developers in creating some web applications. Some of my works are
        linked in this website as you may like to view them.
        I enjoy spending time with my wife but when I am not doing that, I am learning new trends in software development</p>
